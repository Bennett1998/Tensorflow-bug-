RuntimeError: Cannot clone object <tensorflow.python.keras.wrappers.scikit_learn.KerasRegressor object at 0x000001FF6B3A76D8>, as the constructor either does not set or modifies parameter layer_size
RuntimeError: Cannot clone object <tensorflow.python.keras.wrappers.scikit_learn.KerasRegressor object at 0x000001A7808D9470>, as the constructor either does not set or modifies parameter learning_rate

Reason: Maybe win10 doesn't support the hyperparameters searching to "learning rate" or "layers size"temporaryly
